[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/IgiCodes/OctoCord/pulls)

Bridge your GitHub issues and Discord discussions.  
Create, sync, and manage GitHub issues directly from a Discord forum channel.

## ‚ú® Features

- Interactive GitHub issue creation from Discord  
- Label selection synced from GitHub  
- Organized command structure with subcommands (`/utils`, `/github ‚Ä¶`)  
- Automatic linking between GitHub issues and Discord threads (coming soon)  
- TypeScript + [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) + [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js)  
- Explicit, strongly typed event/command registration  
- GitHub App authentication (short-lived installation tokens, no personal PATs)

## üìú Commands

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 24+ (managed via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) in this repo)  
- A Discord Application with a bot user  
- A GitHub App installed on your repo with **Issues (read & write)** + **Metadata (read-only)** permissions  

### Setup

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/IgiCodes/OctoCord.git
cd OctoCord
mise install
pnpm install
```

Copy the example env config and fill in your secrets:

```sh
cp mise.example.toml mise.local.toml
```

Update the values inside with:
- **Discord** ‚Üí bot token, app ID, guild ID  
- **GitHub App** ‚Üí app ID, installation ID, PEM private key (string form), repo owner, repo name  

---

## üöÄ Development

Run the bot in dev mode:

```sh
mise run dev
```

Register slash commands with Discord:

```sh
mise run register-commands
```

Build for production:

```sh
mise run build
```

Start compiled bot:

```sh
mise run start
```

---

## üê≥ Docker

The project includes a ready-to-use `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml`.  
Docker workflows are integrated into `mise` tasks.

### Build & Run with Docker

Bring up the bot in Docker (generates `.env` automatically):

```sh
mise run docker-up
```

Start the bot in detached mode:

```sh
mise run docker-start
```

Stop and remove containers:

```sh
mise run docker-down
```

View logs from the running container:

```sh
mise run docker-logs
```

Rebuild the image manually (without running):

```sh
mise run docker-build
```

### Environment Variables

- A `.env` file is generated from `mise` tasks (`mise run generate-env`).  
- The `.env` file is mounted automatically into the container by `compose.yml`.  
- Secrets (Discord token, GitHub keys, etc.) are pulled from this file.

### Healthcheck

The container exposes a health endpoint:

```
GET /healthz
```

Docker Compose uses this for automatic restart if the bot crashes.

### Register Slash Commands in Docker

To push commands to Discord from inside the container:

```sh
mise run docker-register-commands
```

This will execute dist/utils/registerCommands.js within the running container.

## üîí Security

- Secrets (`.env`, `mise.local.toml`, PEM key) are **never committed** ‚Äî check `.gitignore`.  
- GitHub App credentials are short-lived installation tokens, not long-lived PATs.  
- Webhook secret support planned (to verify incoming GitHub ‚Üí Discord events).

- [ ] Sync thread replies ‚Üí GitHub issue comments  
- [ ] Support closing/reopening issues from Discord  
- [ ] Support multiple repos per server
